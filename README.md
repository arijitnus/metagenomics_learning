# metagenomics_learning
I have had a tough time learning metagenomic data analyses,  especially when shell scripting was very new to me. Through this page, 
I intend to help newbies be able to perform metagenome data analyses on their own. I specifically have mentioned, 
which problems I faced and how did I solve those issues.
