#Following cleaning of your raw reads, they are ready to be assembled into contigs:
#There are two main ways to assemble reads into contigs
#co-assembly (all samples into one) and individual samples (one for each of the samples) assembly 
#co-assembly:
#Need to create interleaved files from paired end reads
Code:
\\#!/bin/bash
bash
. ~/.bashrc
bash interleave_fastq.sh cleaned_sample1_1.fq cleaned_sample1_2.fq > int_sample1.fq 

#The interleave_fastq.sh is attached in this folder, which you can use to create interleaved files from paired end reads.

#The following command assembles all files using megahit from all the interleaved files:
megahit --12 sample1.fq, sample2.fq, sample3.fq --k-min 27 --k-max 197 --k-step 10 –min_contigs_len 1000 -t 10 

#Here the above --12 command inputs all the interleaved files together for assembly. --k-min, max and step indicates the k-mer approach for assembling into contigs and 
#Contigs with only length > 1000 shall be retained with 10 threads on the CPU. Changes can be included as desired by the user.

###Individual assembly:
megahit -1 cleaned_sample1_1.fq -2 cleaned_sample1_2.fq --k-min 27 --k-max 197 --k-step 10 –min_contigs_len 1000 -t 10
