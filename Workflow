The workflow consists of the following steps in brief: 

Metagenome assembly: From reads to contigs to MAGs and downstream analyses of MAGs

1. Trim raw reads for low-quality regions
2. Assembling into contigs
3. Read containment of contigs 
3. From contigs to bins (Metabat2, Maxbin2 and CONCOCT)
4. DAStools for non-redundant set of bins
5. refineM and MAGpurify for removing contaminating contigs
6. checkM for estimating the quality of bins
7. Inferring pathways and functional potential of MAGs



Functional annotation of metagenomes: (Inference from contigs)

1. Inferring functional potential using KEGG, COG , CaZymes and antiSMASH
2. Parsing individual metagenomes into matrix for downstreama analyses
3. Statistical analyses for inferring functional enrichment/depletion and ordination
4. Visualization to show patterns among groups
5. Pathway visualization for biological knowledge extraction
